# Back-End Developer Test

## Overview
Your client has tasked you with making a RESTful API to support the ultimate Moviegoers Guide suite of applications.
They are asking for an API that serves up:

* A list of movies
  * The user should be able to search the movies by title
  * The user should be able to filter the movies by rating
  * The user should be able to filter the movies by category
* Movie details for each movie
* A list of actors in a movie

We have provided a mysql database of movie info for you.
We have also provided a starter PHP application using the SLIM framework although you are free to use the language and framework of your choice - Ruby, Node, etc.

### Keep in mind the following questions

* What design patterns did you use?
* How would you test your application?
* What ways could you structure the code to make it easy to understand and maintain?
* What other considerations and tradeoffs did you make when building the application?

## Installation

### Docker
You will need Docker installed.
Here are the instructions to install Docker for ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)) or ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)). For older systems that do not meet the docker requirements, use the [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview) installation instructions.

_NOTE if using Docker Toolbox_: To verify you may have to use the ip address of the docker machine. In the _verify installation_ section you will want to use the ip address returned by `docker-machine ip` instead of localhost.

### Composer

You will also need to install Composer if you plan to use our starter PHP application.
Here are the instructions to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)

Launch the test code with the following commands

```
cd developer_test_server/movies
composer install
cd ../
docker-compose up -d
```

### Verify Installation

In a browser navigate to http://localhost:3000/movies. You should see ```[]``` returned from the request.

_Note_: If you don't see the empty array, run ```docker-compose logs``` and wait for all the containers to be fully loaded. Once the containers are completely loaded you should be able to hit the movies endpoint.

### Database Connection Information

__host__: 127.0.0.1<br />
__username__: sakila<br />
